      <p> Hi, I'm a student at Stony Brook University studying computer science!</p>
      <p> I'm looking for opportunities in software to gain valuable experience and contribute to cool projects. I hope to utilize my experience, receive feedback on my skills, improve my knowledge, discover my interests, and grow as a software developer by working here. 
          In particular, I'm hoping to learn about industry standards for well-written code and learn about he software development lifecycle in a real production setting. </p>
      <p> I want to be a software engineer because I want to be challenged in by creating solutions to difficult problems. I was really fascinated by this new way of thinking in my first CS course, and the fact that software engineers are able to incorporate technology
          life-long learning ultimately led me to pursue this field. I'm still trying to discover what I enjoy doing most, but I think I've narrowed my options to backend development, databases, and working with big datasets. I really enjoy how the backend works
          behind-the-scenes similar to a chef. It's our duty to communicate data seemlessly between the server, application, and database.</p>
